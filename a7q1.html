A majority of jobs are at risk with the growing use of AI in different industries, such as salespeople, accountants, real estate agents, and insurance agents to drivers. In short, the jobs that required unskilled labour are at risk of being eliminated first.

The growth of AI can also lead to emergence of new professions, new job descriptions, new sectors, new initiatives and new business opportunities. In fact, a recent report by the most prominent IT industry research firm Gartner estimates that enterprise technology powered by AI will create more jobs than it eliminates. In other words, AI cannot create on its own, it needs a human touch to lead and direct the action that will further help in revolutionize the market. Moreover, the industries use AI mainly to do a specific task on repeat rather that work on a task that require an emotional intelligence and an experience of the human world to be 
      successful.
